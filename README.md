<h1>On-premises Active Directory Deployed in the Cloud (Azure)</h1>
Welcome Back! This tutorial outlines the implementation of on-premises Active Directory within Azure Virtual Machines.<br />



<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Active Directory Domain Services
- PowerShell

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows Server 2022
- Windows 10 (21H2)

<h2>High-Level Deployment and Configuration Steps</h2>

- Setup Resources in Azure
- Ensure Connection between Client and Domain Controller
- Install Active Directory and Admin Creation
- Create X-Amount of Client Users using PowerShell Script

<h2>Setup Resources in Azure</h2>

<p>
1. Create the Domain Controller VM (Windows Server 2022) named “DC-1"
   Take note of the Resource Group and Virtual Network (Vnet) that get created at this time
2. Set Domain Controller’s NIC Private IP address to be static
DC-1 > Networking > NIC > IP Configurations
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
3. Create the Client VM (Windows 10) named “Client-1”. Use the same Resource Group and Vnet that was created in the DC-1 step.
4. Ensure that both VMs are in the same Vnet [you can check the topology with Network Watcher]
Here is an illustration of what we are doing:

</p>

</p>DC-1 has to have a static Private IP Address. Client one will connect to DC-1 to ensure connectivity we will try to ping DC-1 from Client-1. At first the ping will not work correctly. We have to enable ICMPv4 on the firewall on DC-1. Now we can ping DC-1 successfully from Client-1

 <h2>Install Active Directory<h2>

 1. Login to DC-1 and install Active Directory Domain Services
    
 
 - Server Manager > "Add Roles and Features" > Check "Active Directory Domain Services"

 Promote the VM to DC, setup a new forest as "mydomain.com" afterwards restart then log back into DC-1 as user: "mydomain.com\labuser". If you performed the steps properly you should be able to run AD Users & Computers as shown below.

Excellent! We can start creating Organizational Units (OU). Let's first create an OU named _EMPLOYEES. Create another OU named _ADMINS. In order to do that right click on the domain area. Select new->Organizational Unit and fill out the field. Then click inside of your OU and right click, select new and select user and fill out the information for your new user. The user should be named Jane Doe, she is going to be an Admin so her username will be Jane_admin. Lastly add Jane to the domain admins security group.

From now on you can use Jane_admin as the administrator account. Now we will join Client-1 to the domain (mydomain.com) from the azure portal we will change client-1's DNS settings to the DC's Private IP address. After you do that restart Client-1 from within the Azure portal. Our picture below shows verification that client-1 is on the DC-1 DNS.
